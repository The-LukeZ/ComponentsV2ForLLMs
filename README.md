# Discord: Message Components V2 (for LLMs)

This repository contains a markdown documentation file [`docs.md`](/docs.md) designed for use with LLMs.

The goal is to provide a clear, structured reference for Discord's Message Components V2, making it easy for LLMs to answer questions or generate Components V2 JSON.

The source was the Components Reference documentation provided by Discord [here](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/blob/main/docs/components/reference.mdx).
I just stripped it down to the essentials.

## Features

- **LLM-friendly format:** Optimized for parsing and understanding by AI models.
- **Comprehensive coverage:** Includes details on all message components V2, without unnecessary details.
- **Easy integration:** Simply provide [`docs.md`](/docs.md) as input to your LLM for enhanced Discord bot development support.

## Usage

1. Download the [`docs.md`](/docs.md) file.
2. Use the file as a reference or input for your LLM-powered tools.

   You can also give it the raw link [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-LukeZ/ComponentsV2ForLLMs/main/docs.md).
